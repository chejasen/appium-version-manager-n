# avm
This is a fork of the avm here: https://github.com/abhinavsingh/avm, which has been inactive for more than years.

I added fixes to make it easier to use.

# Changes:
1. 'avm' with no parameter will show the installed Appium versions.
2. fixed the 'avm list' command that didn't work

Appium version manager, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

## Installation

Clone the script, then:

    $ make install

to `$HOME`. Prefix later calls to `avm` with `PREFIX=$HOME`

    $ PREFIX=$HOME make install

### Install Appium versions

Install a appium version: $ avm <version>, e.g.

    $ avm latest
    $ avm 0.16.0
    $ avm 0.17.6

Type `avm` to see the installed Appium versions.

Switch to the previous version you were using:

    $ avm prev

### Remove Appium versions

Remove some versions:

    $ avm rm 0.16.0 0.18.1

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ avm - 0.18.1

### Appium Usage

When running multiple versions of appium, we can target
them directly by asking `avm` for the binary path:

    $ avm bin 0.16.0
    /usr/local/avm/versions/0.16.0/node_modules/appium/bin/appium.js

Or by using a specific version through `avm`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ avm use 0.18.1 -p 4723 -U c9ccb3bs43ef70cb0d79a113c21a6b4bbee03e28 --app com.app.bundle.id

## Usage

Output from `avm --help`:

    Usage: avm [options] [COMMAND] [args]

    Commands:

      avm                            Output versions installed
      avm latest                     Install or activate the latest appium release
      avm <version>                  Install appium <version>
      avm use <version> [args ...]   Execute appium <version> with [args ...]
      avm bin <version>              Output bin path for <version>
      avm rm <version ...>           Remove the given version(s)
      avm prev                       Revert to the previously activated version
      avm --latest                   Output the latest appium version available
      avm ls                         Output the versions of appium available

    Options:

      -V, --version   Output current version of avm
      -h, --help      Display help information

    Aliases:

      which   bin
      as      use
      list    ls
      -       rm

## Details

 `avm` by default installs appium to _/usr/local/avm/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously 
 installed versions of appium when `avm <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated appium binary is then installed by symlinking to _/usr/local/bin/appium_.

 To alter where `avm` operates simply export __AVM_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
 It defaults to _/usr/local_
